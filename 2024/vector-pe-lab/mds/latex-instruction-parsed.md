# Derivative Calculation

Let’s find the derivative of constant function f(x) = α. The differential coefficient of f(x) at x = a is

lim f(a + ε) − f(a) = lim α − α = lim 0 = 0

ε→0 ε ε→0 ε ε→0

Thus, the derivative of f(x) is f′(x) = 0. This makes sense, since our function is constant—the rate of change is 0.

Note: The differential coefficient of f(x) at x = a is often simply called the derivative of f(x) at x = a, or just f′(a).

Let’s calculate the derivative of linear function f(x) = αx + β. The derivative of f(x) at x = α is

lim f(α + ε) − f(a) = lim α(a + ε) + β − (αa + β) = lim α = α

ε→0 ε ε→0 ε ε→0 ε ε→0

Thus, the derivative of f(x) is f′(x) = α, a constant value. This result should also be intuitive—linear functions have a constant rate of change by definition.

Let’s find the derivative of f(x) = x^2, which appeared in the story. The differential coefficient of f(x) at x = a is

lim f(a + ε) − f(a) = lim (a + ε)^2 − a^2 = lim 2aε + ε^2 = lim 2a + ε = 2a

ε→0 ε ε→0 ε ε→0 ε ε→0 ε ε→0

Thus, the differential coefficient of f(x) at x = a is 2a, or f′(a) = 2a. Therefore, the derivative of f(x) is f′(x) = 2x.

Summary

- The calculation of a limit that appears in calculus is simply a formula calculating an error.
- A limit is used to obtain a derivative.
- The derivative is the slope of the tangent line at a given point.
- The derivative is nothing but the rate of change.
