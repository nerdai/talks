## Calculating the Derivative of a Constant, Linear, or Quadratic Function

|1.|Let’s find the derivative of constant function f(x) = α. The differential coefficient of f(x) at x = a is|
|---|---|
| |lim α → 0 (f(a + ε) - f(a)) / ε = lim α → 0 (α - α) = lim α → 0 0 = 0|
| |Thus, the derivative of f(x) is f′(x) = 0. This makes sense, since our function is constant—the rate of change is 0.|

Note: The differential coefficient of f(x) at x = a is often simply called the derivative of f(x) at x = a, or just f′(a).

|2.|Let’s calculate the derivative of linear function f(x) = αx + β. The derivative of f(x) at x = α is|
|---|---|
| |lim ε → 0 (f(α + ε) - f(a)) = lim ε → 0 (α(a + ε) + β - (αa + β)) = lim ε → 0 α = α|
| |Thus, the derivative of f(x) is f′(x) = α, a constant value. This result should also be intuitive—linear functions have a constant rate of change by definition.|

|3.|Let’s find the derivative of f(x) = x^2, which appeared in the story. The differential coefficient of f(x) at x = a is|
|---|---|
| |lim ε → 0 ((a + ε)^2 - a^2) / ε = lim ε → 0 (a^2 + 2aε + ε^2 - a^2) = lim ε → 0 (2aε + ε^2) = lim ε → 0 (2a + ε) = 2a|
| |Thus, the differential coefficient of f(x) at x = a is 2a, or f′(a) = 2a. Therefore, the derivative of f(x) is f′(x) = 2x.|

## Summary

- The calculation of a limit that appears in calculus is simply a formula calculating an error.
- A limit is used to obtain a derivative.
- The derivative is the slope of the tangent line at a given point.
- The derivative is nothing but the rate of change.
